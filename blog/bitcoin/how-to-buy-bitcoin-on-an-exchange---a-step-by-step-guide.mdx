### 2. Create and Verify Your Account
- Sign up with your email
- Complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
  - Provide ID
  - Proof of address
  - This is required by law in most countries

### 3. Fund Your Account
- Bank wire transfer (cheapest, recommended)
- Credit/debit card (faster but higher fees)
- Deposit other cryptocurrencies to trade for Bitcoin
- Other payment methods (varies by exchange)

### 4. Place Your Order

When you're ready to buy, go on the spot market. Here, you're buying bitcoin directly at the current market price. You can either place a market order to buy immediately, or a limit order to buy at a specific price you choose. Start small - there's no rush, and it's better to learn with amounts you're comfortable with.
Some exchanges offer options to put automatic regular buys in place. This is a great way to buy bitcoin regularly, avoiding both FOMO and market volatility.
