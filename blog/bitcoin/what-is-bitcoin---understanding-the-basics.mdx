## What is Bitcoin? Why is it so special?

Think of Bitcoin as digital money that exists on a global network, similar to how emails exist on the internet. Unlike traditional money that's controlled by banks and governments, Bitcoin is maintained by a peer-to-peer network of computers worldwide, making it truly decentralized, borderless and independent.

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Decentralized - no central control</li>
        <li>Fixed supply of 21 million coins</li>

Bitcoin represents a revolutionary shift in how money works. Traditional government-issued currencies (like dollars or euros) can be created endlessly by central banks through a process called "money printing." This constant increase in money supply leads to inflation - meaning your savings lose purchasing power over time.

<Tip>
  Bitcoin solves this fundamental problem through its fixed supply of 21 million coins. No one, not even governments, can create more bitcoin beyond this limit.
</Tip>

This scarcity is enforced by the network's code and mathematics, not by human decisions.

Think of it this way: When governments print more money out of thin air, they're essentially diluting the value of all existing money - like adding water to juice. Bitcoin, by contrast, is designed to become more valuable over time as demand increases while supply remains fixed. This makes it an excellent store of value, similar to digital gold.

But Bitcoin goes further - it's also:

These properties make Bitcoin not just digital money, but a profound innovation in monetary systems - one that protects wealth from inflation and gives financial sovereignty back to individuals.

## How Bitcoin Works

<Accordion title="Bitcoins">
  <div className="mt-4">
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Supply</strong>: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, making it a scarce digital asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Bitcoin is fungible (each unit is identical), divisible, and easily transferable.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: The smallest unit is called a "satoshi" (0.00000001 bitcoin).</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: You can buy any fraction of a bitcoin - no need to purchase a whole one.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Each bitcoin is stored at an address (like an email address for receiving money). The address is generated from a public key, which is derived from a private key. The address is safe to share, but the private key is like your password and should never be shared.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keys and Addresses">
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>You control your bitcoin through:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
      <li><strong>Private Key</strong>: Like your password - never share it</li>
      <li><strong>Public Key</strong>: Derived from your private key through one-way cryptography</li>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin Address</strong>: Like your email address - safe to share</li>
    </ul>
    <Warning className="mt-4">
      Anyone who has your private key can spend your bitcoin. Keep it secure and never share it with anyone.
    </Warning>
  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Bitcoin Network">
  <div className="mt-4">
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>The Network</strong>: Bitcoin lives on a network of computers (nodes) that keep track of all transactions via a shared ledger called the blockchain.</li>
      <li><strong>Blocks</strong>: All transactions are recorded in blocks, creating a permanent, immutable history of all bitcoin transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Transactions</strong>: Moving bitcoin involves sending from one address to another. This is done via a transaction, which is a record of a transfer from one address to another. To send bitcoin, you need to have the private key of the address you want to send from and sign the transaction with your private key. This is handled by your wallet.</li>
    </ul>

The beauty of Bitcoin lies in its simplicity: once you own bitcoin, you truly own it. There's no bank that can freeze your account, no government that can seize it, and no middleman needed to send it to anyone, anywhere in the world, almost instantly.
